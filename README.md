# iOS: user management in Swift 

This repo is associated to an [iOS tutorials/samples series](http://pragmatictheories.tech/category/ios/) I am currently sharing.
It helps you implement user management in Swift with Alamofire and MySQL and includes a Facebook registration module.

## Description

This repo and [the associated tutorial](http://pragmatictheories.tech/category/ios/) demos the following:

* ### Use of [LoginKit](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/LoginKit) for Login/Signup UX
LoginKit takes care of the UI, the forms, the data validation, and Facebook SDK access. All we need to add is the necessary calls to our own backend API to login or signup.

* ### Use of Alamofire to consume custom backend API for user registration
A very simple php backend for signup/login to a MySQL database is consumed through the [Alamofire HTTP networking library](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire):
